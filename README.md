# T20-World-Cup-2024-Match-Analysis

This repository contains a detailed analysis of the T20 World Cup 2024 match between India and the United States of America. The project uses ball-by-ball innings data to derive key statistics, visualize performance metrics, and provide insights into the match dynamics. Built with Python, Pandas, and Plotly, this analysis includes batter and bowler statistics, run progressions, partnership contributions, and more.

## Overview

This project provides an analysis of T20 World Cup 2024 matches using Python and data visualization techniques. The analysis includes team performance, player statistics, match outcomes, and other key insights derived from match data.
The analysis focuses on the India vs. USA match from the T20 World Cup 2024. Using a ball-by-ball dataset, the project computes and visualizes:

1.Total runs and wickets for each team.

2.Batter-specific statistics (runs, balls faced, strike rate, boundaries).

3.Bowler-specific statistics (wickets, runs conceded, economy rate, dot balls).

4.Run progression, wicket timelines, and partnership contributions.

5.Key moments in the innings (e.g., wickets falling, significant scoring).

6.Run rate comparisons between the teams.

7.The dataset (india-usa_innings_data.csv) contains 236 rows and 21 columns, capturing detailed ball-by-ball information.

## Features

**Match Data Analysis**: Insights into team performances, run rates, wickets, and player contributions.

**Visualization**: Graphs and charts for better understanding of match trends.

**Comparative Analysis**: Comparison of team performances across different matches.

**Predictive Insights**: Basic predictions on match outcomes using regression-based analysis.

**Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values and ensures data consistency.

**Statistical Analysis**: Computes key metrics like strike rates, economy rates, and total extras.

**Visualizations**:
  
   1.Run progression over overs for both teams.
  
   2.Wicket timelines.
  
   3.Batter run distribution.
  
   4.Bowler performance (economy rate vs. wickets).
  
   5.Partnership contributions (stacked bar charts).
  
   6.Key moments in the innings with annotations.
  
   7.Run rate comparisons (average and per over).

**Interactive Charts**: Uses Plotly for dynamic and visually appealing graphs.

## Technologies Used

1.Python

2.Pandas (for data manipulation)

3.Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

4.Scikit-learn (for predictive analysis)

5.Jupyter Notebook (for running the analysis)

## Usage

1.Load the dataset (t20_wc_2024_matches.csv) into the Jupyter Notebook.

2.Run the analysis scripts to generate insights.

3.Visualize the trends and key statistics.

## Dataset

The dataset I am using provides a comprehensive record of the innings, including player performance, team statistics, and specific events like dismissals and reviews.
