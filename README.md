# T20-World-Cup-2024-Match-Analysis

This repository contains a detailed analysis of the T20 World Cup 2024 match between India and the United States of America. The project uses ball-by-ball innings data to derive key statistics, visualize performance metrics, and provide insights into the match dynamics. Built with Python, Pandas, and Plotly, this analysis includes batter and bowler statistics, run progressions, partnership contributions, and more.

## Overview

This project provides an analysis of T20 World Cup 2024 matches using Python and data visualization techniques. The analysis includes team performance, player statistics, match outcomes, and other key insights derived from match data.
The analysis focuses on the India vs. USA match from the T20 World Cup 2024. Using a ball-by-ball dataset, the project computes and visualizes:

2.Batter-specific statistics (runs, balls faced, strike rate, boundaries).

3.Bowler-specific statistics (wickets, runs conceded, economy rate, dot balls).

4.Run progression, wicket timelines, and partnership contributions.

5.Key moments in the innings (e.g., wickets falling, significant scoring).

6.Run rate comparisons between the teams.

7.The dataset (india-usa_innings_data.csv) contains 236 rows and 21 columns, capturing detailed ball-by-ball information.
